3. Markdownlint
Markdownlint is a linter for Markdown files. Think of it as a spell-checker or grammar-checker for your Markdown. It helps enforce consistent style and formatting rules. Here’s what it does:

    - Identifies issues like missing blank lines, inconsistent heading styles, or improperly formatted lists.
    - Helps improve the readability and maintainability of your Markdown documents.
    - Ensures compliance with Markdown standards (e.g., CommonMark, GitHub Flavored Markdown).
    - For example, Markdownlint might warn you about:
      - Incorrect heading spacing: #Heading instead of # Heading.
      - Inconsistent list markers: Mixing - and * in the same list.
      - Unnecessary trailing spaces.

These extensions serve complementary purposes:

- Markdown All in One: For editing productivity.
- Markdown Preview Enhanced: For rich previews and exports.
- Markdownlint: For maintaining clean and consistent Markdown.
