# General Raid Preparation: 
Before diving into tanking specifics, ensure you’re prepared:

#### Setup your environment
- Stable Internet/PC Updated Etc
- A good micHave a working microphone to communicate effectively during raids.
-  Ensure your internet connection is stable to avoid disconnections
	- If I've been playing all day I restart the game/client and or PC.
- Focus
	- A Find a quiet space free from distractions or disturbances, Minuel.
-  Minimize background noise to stay focused during intense battles.
-   Ensure your PC is in working order:
-   Verify that your addons are up to date, DBM/Threat meters.
 
#### Warrior Abilities



#### Threat
Here is a detailed post about threat and what ablities a Tank warrior has to maintain it.
**[A Warrior’s Gui:
-   Essential addons for tanking include to Threat, Aggro, and Tanking](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bif380/a_warriors_guide_to_threat_aggro_and_tanking/)**

#### Gearing your Tank
Ensure you have at least 6 hit with a shield on.
Use Item Rack or similar to create gear sets.
Refer to Wow Logs to check what other tanks wear.
Here is the fight club gear list.
**[Fight Club Best In Slot - Raid Tank P6](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing#)**

The Ranking Shoulders and Boots give a nice stamina bonus. This is great but they don't have any defence on.
As a general rule aim for 350 defence on bosses to avoid crushing damage.

I have a few sets on my war.
1 - FULL Threat DPS - Used for BWL + MC
2 - Additional Stamina
	[Ring of the Qiraji Fury](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://classic.wowhead.com/item%3D21677/ring-of-the-qiraji-fury&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716629101296704&usg=AOvVaw1O7_C6Bn96p66IR3K9s-LX), 
	[Master Dragonslayer's Ring](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://classic.wowhead.com/item%3D19384/master-dragonslayers-ring&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716629101116680&usg=AOvVaw0Wa75rCcWsBKotTXPStRMB)
	[Wristguards of Vengeance](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://classic.wowhead.com/item%3D22936/wristguards-of-vengeance&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716629101121464&usg=AOvVaw2DEh0OEgAf0K1mlOZSRd8j)
	[Sadist's Collar](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://classic.wowhead.com/item%3D23023/sadists-collar&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716629101261934&usg=AOvVaw2esUHQVIZJSpk53YUBxZeE)
	Some mixed items for harder hitting trash. I'm still getting use to the speed of our runs. 
	I can likely use more DPS items.
	Remember Communication with your Healers is likely the most important job of a tank.



###### AQ40 You can use the "Heavy DPS" at the start, at and after**[Princess Huhuran](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15509/princess-huhuran)** you can equip more defensive items, esquailly is most of the dps are saving world buffs as threat won't be as much of an issiue.

###### Naxx
I've 3 Sets, Trash and Light Bosses, mixed and Heavy.
1x Tier 3 Mix of rings, 2.5 bracers
4x Tier 3
7x Tier, Heavy is only used for **[Loatheb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/loatheb-naxxramas-raid-strategy)** and [Sapphiron](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/sapphiron-naxxramas-raid-strategy)


#### Raid Preparation:
World Buffs
- You can Skip Slip’kik’s Savvy as Spell Crit isn’t that helpful
- Rend Buff for tank is essential

Ensure you have a comprehensive list of consumables, have a checklist.

Ask warlocks for Hearthstones (You can hold 2, 1440 HP & 1220 HP) and have a stack of  Whipper Root Tubers.
Here is a complete list of Buffs and Consumables broken into what stacks with what.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MsDWgYDIcPE_5nX6pRbea-hW9JQjYikfCDWk16l5V-8/pubhtml#
 meters, boss mods, and raid frames.
    

#### Raid Preparation:
World Buffs
Make sure you have all relevant world buffs before raiding.
-  Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer
-   Spirit of Zandalar
-   Dire Maul Buffs; Mol’dar’s Moxie, Fengus’ Ferocity.
-   You can Skip Slip’kik’s Savvy as Spell Crit isn’t that helpful
-   Songflower Serenade
-   Rend Buff

Ensure you have a comprehensive list of consumables, have a checklist:
   
-   Flasks: Flask of the Titans or Flask of Chromatic Resistance (for specific encounters).
-   Elixirs: Elixir of Superior Defense, Elixir of Fortitude, and Elixir of Greater Agility.
-   Food: Dirge’s Kickin’ Chimaerok Chops or Juju Might (for additional strength).
-   Potions: Limited Invulnerability Potion, Mighty Rage Potion, and Free Action Potion (for crowd control situations).
-   Miscellaneous: Major Hearthstones  Whipper Root Tuber (for healing).
    

I created a WeakAura for myself.

##### User Interface (UI) Setup:
    
-   Minimalism: Keep your UI minimalistic. Remove unnecessary elements that clutter the screen.
-   Important Information: Display essential information prominently. This includes health, rage, debuffs, and threat meters.
-   Unit Frames: Use clean unit frames for party members, raid members, and target. Customize their size and position for easy visibility.
-   Cooldowns and Buffs: Place cooldown timers and buff/debuff indicators near your character or close to the center of the screen.
-   Threat Meter: Install a threat meter addon (e.g., ClassicThreatMeter or Details!). Position it where you can monitor threat easily during combat.

##### Keybinds and Macros:

*[Intro To Warrior Marcos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1_Nkl1V2gc)*
    
Having some simple Marcos is important.
This for example is my Blood Thirst Macro.

    #showtooltip
    /targetenemy [noexists]
    /cast [nomod] Bloodthirst
    /us    
-   Efficient Keybinds: Assign keybinds to abilities for quick access.  
-   Modifier Keys: Utilize [mod:shift] 14
    /cast [mod:shift] Bloodthirst
    /startattack
    /click BCT
This one is similar however it is my Rage Dump macro.

    #showtooltip
    /targetenemy [noexists]
    /cast [nomod] Bloodthirst
    /use [mod:shift] 14
    /cast [mod:shift] Bloodthirst
    /cast !Heroic Strike
    /startattack
    /click BCT
Having /cancelaura Salv is good for an OT, I put mine in Taunt.

    #showtooltip
    /cast [nomod,form:1/3] Defensive Stance
    /cast [nomod, form:2] Taunt
    /cast [mod:shift, form:2] Disarm
    /cancelaura [form:2] Greater Blessing of Salvation 
    /cancelaura [form:2] Blessing of Salvation
   
   This one is my interrupt and Shield Marco

/use [nomod, form:1] Thunder Clap
/use [nomod, form:3] Whirlwind
/cast [mod:shift, form:1/3] Pummel
/stopcasting [form:2, noworn:shields]
/cast [nomod, form:2] Shield Block
/cast [mod:shift, form:2] Shield Bash
/eq [form:2, noworn:shields] 16 item:23043
    
This is very important becausifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) to expand your keybind options.
    
-   Macros: Create macros for common actions. For example:
-   A macro that combines Bloodthirst with Heroic Strike.
-   Consistency: Try to keep keybinds consistent across characters to build muscle memory.
    

##### Addons for Tanking:
    

-   Threat Plates: Enhances nameplates to show threat levels on enemies.
-   WeakAuras: Customizable alerts for abilities, debuffs, and cooldowns.
-   ClassicCastbars: Improves castbar visibility for interrupting spells.
    

##### Raid Awareness

-   Check who is in the Raid
-   Dps, Healers look at the damage wthen taking a Crit/Crushing damag DPS are doing and the you want to put a shield on.
Note that it is important to have /stopput of the pallys.
-   Do they cross heal, to the dps have a threat meter?
-   Communicasting because having Heroic Strike queued will delay your swap to a Shield.

An addon that is very helpful for managing your macro's is called **Marco Manager**
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/macromanager
#### Addons for Tanking:
    
There are afew helpful addons and weak auras.
I created afew for myself. The most resent was an audio warning when I take a crit or crushing blow as these can one shot a tank with bad RNG.
- At a miniium you need:
- Threat management
	- Details with Tiny Threat Plugin
- Boss Raid Tracker
	- DBM
-  Threat Plates
	- Enhances nameplates to show threat levels on enemies.
-   WeakAuras
	- Customizable alerts for abilities, debuffs, and cooldowns.
    

##### Raid Awareness

A good habit to get into is to judge the DPS/Healing in a raid.
Even in a 20 man instance.
It is common to have players new to a class in BIS gear and experienced players in mixed gear mid table.
    

##### Rotation
Descending Priority ( Main Tank )
- BT ( On CD, Son is the biggest thing in classic.
-   The team work here is very importnat.
-   I’ve  hard carried some Ony’s with 5 ppl alive because I inspected all the healers and spoke with them while the group took time to get together.
    

##### Rotation
Bloodthirst (BT) + Heroic Strike (HS):

- Priority: Always use BT as your main threat ability. It should be your first global cooldown (GCD) whenever available.
 - HS: If you have enough rage, follow BT with HS. This combo generates significant threat.  
 - Rage Management: Be mindful of rage. Don’t overspend it, especially if you’re saving rage for the next Ppack ) use the Marco above to include HS when rage permits
- Revenge
- Sunder

As Main Tank your Goal is to have enough Threat to allow the DPS to open up.
Skull will likely die quickly
Help sunder the 2/3/4 mark once skull is dead.

Additional Tanks should open with Sunder with one important exception.
When moving into a pack of mobs with high damage and or AOE abilities is it best to open with Demo Shout then Sunder.
A good example of this is the Trash After Twins in AQ40 if taking a full pack of Slayers.

Sunder Armor.
-.
 - Revenge (Revenging Blow):
 - Additional Threat: If Revenge is off cooldown, use it for extra threat.
- Healthy Threat Lead: If you already have a comfortable threat lead, you can skip Revenge. Learn to gauge when this is appropriate for your situation.
    

##### Sunder Armor:   
- Cooldown: Use Sunder Armor while BT is on cooldown.  
	- Even with 5 Sunders: Even if the target already has 5 stacks of Sunder Armor, continue using it for additional  threat.
	- Rogue’s Improved Expose Armor.
	-: If you have a rogue applying Improved Expose Armor, use Battle Shout to fill the Global.
	   - Battle Shout generates more threat than Sunder Armor if it hits your whole group.
    
## - Use It: Cast Battle Shout when needed, especially during pulls or when your group lacks the buff
    

Wow classic warrior talents.

Fury Warrior in classic wow has afew options for you to play with.


In GDKPs the follow should be used a template for the Main Tank


This spec is the best in terms of value espically if your playing OT warrior.  
You keep the faster taunt and you also gain piecing howl.  
This can be a great spell in general but also in naxx for some bosses fights  
  
Its your character this is the baseline options, as you can see


## Raid BWL
BWL is one of the more challenging raids because you need to have 2/3 tanks work together for the dragons.

 - 1 - **[Razorgore the Untamed](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12435/razorgore-the-untamed)**
	The tank that clicks the last egg with the dragon, will be top threat.
	Here is the marco for the egg.
	Note *Razorgore is immune to taunt*

- 2 -Vaelastrasz
Starting the Event
Talk to the boss so it is not faceing the alter
Tank Unboon around 20 seconds before the fight
A pally will give you LOH's before the start ( The buff lasts for 2 mins, so don't worry if it is early.

	Around 6-8 Seconds before the fight.
	- Berserker Stance
	- Berserker Rage 
	- Recklessness
	- Defensive Stance
	- Deathwish 
	- Rage Potion
	- Kiss/Slayers/Diamond Flask ( A Trinket )

	Then Bloodthirst > Revenge > Sunder > Battle Shout
	Heroic Strike queued for the whole fight
	*Don't move after the fight as the healing team will still be healing you.*

- 3 - Broodlord Lashlayer
	A Hunter can pull the trash Whelps out the way allowing Rogues maintain Stealth and handle the traps.
	Have a LOH's for the pull and use Stone Shield Potion.
	Position and Pump the boss have last stand ready and shield if your low HP
	Off tanks should be ready to move to tank spot if they take threat.
	Demo Shout is very important on this boss because his abilities scale with his base attack power.
	Positioning

- 4 - Firemaw
	Confirm everyone knows the positioning ( There are a few strategy's but we uses the gate one )

	**[Positioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=z3rjG9MikFA)**
	
- 5 - Ebonroc
	MT Get Priest shield on pull, Position the Boss
	One OT stand on the MT, Taunt when the MT gets [Shadow of Ebonroc]https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23340/shadow-of-ebonroc)

	On pull ensure you have A priest shield
	Get some threat on the boss and position it
	Flamegor does have **[Thrash](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=3391/thrash)** so if you jump down, equip a shield on and cast shield block, return to duel weld after the boss has hit you. 
	Alternatively, you can also walk down stairs with it.
	
	
	*Use Ony Cloak*
	Only need 2 tanks
	OT Taunts the Wing Buffets
	*If the Taunt Resists, the OT can use AOE Taunt/Mocking Blow as the Wing Buffet is cast.*

- 7 - **[Chromaggus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14020/chromaggus)**
	Remember to move forward to collect the boss at the start.
	Be aware of the abilities here
	Note: **[Brood Affliction: Black](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23154/brood-affliction-black)**
	This curse, Fire Damage increased by 100%. Must be decurse instantly because combined with **Incinerate** it will one shot a tank.
